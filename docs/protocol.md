# Facial Movement Capture Protocol
Self-Guided Home Use

## Purpose

This protocol defines how a patient should perform facial movements while using
the Facial Tracker application at home. Its goal is to ensure that facial
movement data is **consistent, comparable over time, and clinically meaningful**,
particularly for patients with peripheral facial palsy (e.g. Bell’s palsy).

This protocol prioritizes **repeatability over expressiveness**.

---

## General Principles

- Perform sessions in **similar conditions every day**
- Do not rush movements
- Do not exaggerate beyond comfort
- Stop if pain or excessive fatigue occurs

The application does **not** provide diagnosis. It is a **tracking and monitoring tool**.

---

## Environment Setup

Before starting a session:

1. **Lighting**
   - Use soft, even lighting
   - Avoid strong shadows on the face
   - Avoid backlighting (window behind you)

2. **Camera**
   - Use a front-facing camera
   - Camera should be at eye level
   - Keep the camera stationary

3. **Background**
   - Plain background preferred
   - Avoid moving objects behind you

---

## Patient Positioning

- Sit upright
- Head facing forward
- Eyes looking at the camera
- Keep head still during each pose
- Do not tilt or rotate the head

The application tracks facial movement assuming a **frontal view**.

---

## Session Structure

A session consists of a sequence of predefined facial poses.

For each pose:

1. Instruction appears on screen
2. Preparation time (≈ 2 seconds)
3. Pose hold (≈ 1–2 seconds)
4. Relax face completely before the next pose

Each pose is performed **once per session** unless otherwise instructed.

## Facial Poses

### P0 — Neutral / Rest

- Relax your face completely
- Lips gently closed
- Eyes open naturally
- No expression

**Purpose:**  
Baseline asymmetry reference.

---

### P1 — Gentle Smile

- Smile softly
- Do not show teeth
- Avoid exaggeration

**Purpose:**  
Measure mild activation of smile muscles.

---

### P2 — Big Smile

- Smile as much as comfortably possible
- Teeth may be visible
- Do not strain

**Purpose:**  
Measure maximum voluntary activation and range.

---

### P3 — Eye Closure

- Close both eyes gently
- Do not squeeze tightly

**Purpose:**  
Assess eye closure symmetry and control.

---

### P4 — Eyebrow Raise

- Raise both eyebrows
- Keep eyes open
- Avoid forehead wrinkling beyond comfort

**Purpose:**  
Assess frontal muscle activation.

---

### P5 — Lip Purse

- Purse lips as if whistling
- Keep jaw relaxed

**Purpose:**  
Assess lip control and symmetry.

---

## Frequency

Recommended usage:
- **Once per day**
- At approximately the same time each day

Higher frequency is allowed but may introduce fatigue effects.

---

## Consistency Notes

To ensure meaningful comparisons:
- Use the same device whenever possible
- Sit at approximately the same distance from the camera
- Follow the same order of poses
- Avoid facial exercises immediately before a session

---

## Safety Notes

- Stop if pain occurs
- Do not force movements
- This application does not replace medical evaluation

If symptoms worsen significantly, contact a healthcare professional.

---

## Data Handling

- All data is stored **locally on the user’s device**
- No data is transmitted externally
- Images and videos may be stored only if explicitly enabled by the user

---

## Limitations

- Results depend on user compliance
- Lighting and camera quality affect accuracy
- The application does not account for non-frontal head poses

These limitations should be considered when interpreting results.
